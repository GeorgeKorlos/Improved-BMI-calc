# BMI Calculator

This Python script calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height and weight, and provides feedback on the BMI category.

## How It Works
1. The user enters their height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms).
2. The script calculates the BMI using the formula:

BMI = Weight/Height^2

3. Based on the BMI value, the script classifies the user's weight status into one of the following categories:
   - Underweight: BMI < 18.5
   - Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 25
   - Slightly overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 30
   - Obese: 30 ≤ BMI < 35
   - Clinically obese: BMI ≥ 35
